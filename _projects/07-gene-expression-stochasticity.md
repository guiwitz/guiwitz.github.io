We acquire high accuracy datasets of bacteria lineages to address questions such as the variability of activity of constitutive promoters, how fluctuations of gene expression couple to fluctuations of cell growth, or the impact of gene expression noise on gene regulation in fluctuating environments. We also study the impact of gene expression noise on growth lags, as well as its impact on the selection of growth lags.
