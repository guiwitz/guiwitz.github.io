Deep learning methods have received a lot of attention in the past years. While in many cases simpler methods works as well, image analysis is the one application where deep learning shines. Using tools such as Keras and Tensorflow which simpligy access to deep learning methods, I am exploring the possibilities to use those to perform image segmentation of microscopy images. Both cells and intra-cellular features (e.g. fluorescent spots) can be segmented. The image below shows how a u-net convolutional network achieves excellent segmentation of dense E.coli cells.
