I was originally trained as a physicist but over the years drifted to biophysics and then biology. Due to this background my research has a strong quantitative orientation and I try to explore research topics where such an approach can make a difference.

My current topic of research is the regulation of the bacterial cell cycle in *E.coli*. To proliferate, bacteria have essentially to double in size and double their genetic material within one generation. Despite the fact *E.coli* is one of the most studied model organism it remains unclear how these two cycles are regulated and in particular how they are coupled.

Being able to observe how these cycles progress in single bacteria in live provides important clues to solve these questions. To achieve that, I use a combination of fluorescence microscopy, microfluidics and image processing to observe thousands of complete cell cylces and understand the underlying mechanisms. The video below shows cells growing in horizontal channels open on the right. The red dots show the position of the origin of replication, while the green signal indicates the position of the division machinery.
