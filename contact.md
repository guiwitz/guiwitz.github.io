If you visit us, the Exakte Wissenchafften (ExWi) building can easily be reached by foot from the main train station. In the main passage under the tracks head in the direction *opposite* of the main hall until you reach elevators. Take the elevator to the highest level. Upon exiting, you will be on the *Grosse Schanze* where you will find the main University building. The ExWi building is a bit further right next to it facing the splendind view of the Alps.
